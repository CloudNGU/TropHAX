# TropHAX
You must install the plugin (obviously), it is your choice whether to use the *TITLEID or *ALL, it should not load on system apps, if you experience otherwise, please report.

After the plugin is installed, start up the desired game and hit Start+Select to enable the plugin.
It will tell you to wait, when it prompts you to hit L+R you may do so once it reaches the main menu of the game or wait longer to increase compatibility.

The screen will go blue and load the plugin.
It will then go through all your trophies.
