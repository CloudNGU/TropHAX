# TropHAX

You must install the plugin (obviously), it is your choice whether to use the *TITLEID or *ALL, it should not load on system apps, if you experience otherwise, please report.

After the plugin is installed, start up the desired game and once at the main menu hit Start+Select to enable the plugin.
Now you can use L+R to unlock all or L+START to unlock a specific trophy, use L+UP and L+DOWN to make your selection
then L+CIRCLE to unlock

# Compatibility 
TropHAX should work on about 90% of games.

If you have any problems post them in the issues section 

Trophys will sync online. so there is a potential ban risk
use a different account, or simply use offline if you care.
